Subjects are asked to pick the plot in the lineup where the groups are the most separated, so we would expect that more subjects would pick the plots with the largest average separation. In general, this happens, the tallest pins are in the right of each cell. The top three rows show the results for the data with separation, so the observed data plot (red) is typically the pin on the very left of the cell, less so for the higher dimensions which are the cells at right.

The vertical line represents difference equal to 1 when the average separation of the observed data plot is equal to the maximum average separation of the null plots for 2D projection. The points left to the line indicates a difficult lineup in the sense that at least one of the null plots had a lower average separation value than the observed data plot.
