\chapter{INTRODUCTION}\label{ch:introduction}


\section{Background}

Plotting data has its origins long before the development of the classical inference procedures, and then developed alongside these methods. The first recorded instance of statistical graphics based on the data was known to be in the year 1644 (variations in determination of longitude between Toledo and Rome as illustrated by \cite{friendly:2001}). The development of inferential procedures started with Bernoulli (1700s) and gathered speed with Fisher (early 1900s) and has continued strongly through to present times \citep{hald:2004}. 

The importance of statistical plots in statistical data analysis is widely understood. Model diagnosis and exploratory data analysis is predominantly dependent on statistical plots. \cite{cleveland:1984} began to formalize development of graphical methods with experiments in visual perception. \cite{hadley:2009}, building on ideas originating in \cite{wilkinson:1999}, developed and implemented a grammar of graphics which presents a structured way to generate specific graphics from data and helps to define connections between disparate types of plot. Statistical graphs has been widely used for going beyond the standard paradigms of estimation and testing, to look for patterns in data beyond the expected. As pointed out by \cite{gelman:2004}, improvements in technology has helped in the development of statistical graphics. Higher resolution graphics, more sophisticated user interfaces and accessible software such as R \citep{r} has made graphical methods to be more widely available.  The problem is, although we can explore and represent our findings using statistical graphics, it has been difficult to say that what we see is ``real''. This thesis research helps to fill this void.

% to look presentation of findings. The question is whether we can use this powerful tool, the statistical plots, to make statistical inference. This has been a open question until recently when \citet{buja:2009} presented formal structure of the visual inference procedure to detect the significant pattern in the data.

%
%I intend to write down a little history of the statistical graphics in this section. The goal is to identify why the graphics were not used as a tool for statistical inference even though we see its presence way before the development of classical inference techniques. One factor could be the absence of modern computing facilities. But to what extent does the lack of computing facility prevent statistical graphics from being used as the tool for statistical inference?

\section{Review of Hypothesis Testing}

Classical statistical inference can be broadly classified into two categories, namely estimation and testing of hypothesis. In testing of hypothesis we start out with a claim or belief about the population parameter. We need to verify the claim or belief based on whether our sample data matches the belief. In any test, there are two competing hypotheses. The null hypothesis denoted by $H_0$ is a statement of what we assume to be true which reflects the current condition about the population parameter. On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis, denoted by $H_a$ which is a statement against the null hypothesis $H_0$ is what we want to show. 

The philosophy behind a statistical hypothesis is the same as in a jury trial. There are only two possibilities:

\begin{itemize} \itemsep 0in
\item ``not guilty'' corresponding to $H_0$
\item ``guilty'' corresponding to $H_a$ 
\end{itemize}

Like in a jury trial the philosophy is ``innocent until proven guilty'', we assume $H_0$ is true until we have sufficient evidence in the data in favor of $H_a$. 
We may have three different types of alternative hypotheses against the null hypothesis. Let us assume we want to test for a population mean $\mu$. So against the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$, we may have three choices of alternatives:

\begin{itemize} \itemsep 0in
\item $H_a: \mu > \mu_0$
\item $H_a: \mu < \mu_0$ 
\item $H_a: \mu \ne \mu_0$
\end{itemize}

\noindent where $\mu_0$ is some pre-specified value that we assume holds true under $H_0$. The first two alternative hypotheses are known as one-sided alternatives and the third one is known as two-sided alternative. Also $H_0$ and $H_a$ should always contradict each other, and jointly cover the population parameter space.

Let us assume that we want to test $$H_0: \mu = \mu_0 \qquad \hbox{vs} \qquad H_a: \mu > \mu_0$$
Now based on the sample we have in hand, we calculate the appropriate sample statistic. So in this case we calculate the sample mean $\bar{x}$ and standard deviation $s$ from sample of size $n$. If $H_a$ is indeed true, we should expect $\bar{x}$ to be greater than $\mu_0$. Then the question of interest is how much greater than $\mu_0$ should $\bar{x}$ be before we start doubting the null hypothesis. In other words, is the value of $\bar{x}$ unusually large if it is really true that $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$. If the answer is yes, then that would be evidence against $H_0$ in favor of $H_a$. To assess how unusual or unlikely our value of $\bar{x}$ is we need to know something about how the statistic, $\bar{X}$, might vary from one sample to another if $H_0$ were really true.  (\cite{kutner:2005} provides extensive explanations of these ideas.)

Assuming that the sample comes from a normal population or the sample size is large enough so that the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ is approximately normal, the standardized score or the test statistic under $H_0$, also known as the $t$-score is given by
$$t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}}$$
Under $H_0$, $t$ follows a $t_{n-1}$ distribution. From this model we can determine the probability of observing that particular value of $t$ or something bigger, which is called the $p$-value. (See, for example, \cite{moore:2009}.) If it is small then it is pretty unlikely, which is evidence against $H_0$, which would lead us to believe that the sample comes from a distribution where $\mu>\mu_0$, that is, $H_a$. This is considered to be rejecting the null hypothesis.

More generally we can write the test statistic for any population parameter as 
$$\frac{\hbox{sample estimate of parameter} - \hbox{hypothesized parameter value under }H_0 }{\hbox{standard error of the estimator}}$$ 
Under different situations, we would hope to be able to determine the distribution of this test statistic in order to compute the $p$-value. 

The next step is the definition of how small is small. This is determined by the level of significance, $\alpha$, also called the Type I error. It is the controlled error, the probability that we are wrong in rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is really true. The value of $\alpha$ is set to a level that we are willing to risk being wrong, typically 0.05, but sometimes 0.1 or 0.01, or even lower. Deciding whether the $p$-value is small corresponds comparing it with $\alpha$:
 
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 0in
\item Reject $H_0$ if $p$-value $<$ $\alpha$
\item Fail to reject $H_0$ if $p$-value $>$ $\alpha$
\end{itemize}

Equivalently we can also decide to reject or fail to reject $H_0$ by first determining the 100(1 - $\alpha$) percentile value of $t_{n-1}$ distribution, called the critical value, $t_{n-1}(\alpha)$. This is compared to the observed value of the test statistic, $t$, leading to the decision criteria (Figure \ref{classical}) being:

\begin{itemize} \itemsep 0in
\item Reject $H_0$ if $t > t_{n-1}(\alpha)$
\item Fail to reject $H_0$ if $t < t_{n-1}(\alpha)$
\end{itemize}

Different alternative hypothesis require slightly different comparisons. The two-sided alternative, $H_a: \mu \ne \mu_0$, requires using: 

\begin{itemize}\itemsep 0in
\item Reject $H_0$ if $|t| > t_{n-1}(\alpha)$
\item Fail to reject $H_0$ if $|t| < t_{n-1}(\alpha)$
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{diagram.pdf}}
\caption{Decision regions  for classical inference for $H_0: \mu=\mu_0$ vs $H_a:\mu>\mu_0$.}
\label{classical}
\end{figure}

Type I error, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true. Type II error, denoted by $\beta$ is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false. Type I error is committed in a jury trial when it is decided that a not guilty person is  ``guilty''. This is a serious mistake as an innocent person is punished. Type II error is committed when there is a guilty person is not convicted, not considered to be so serious. The power of a statistical test is defined as the probability that the test will reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false i.e the power of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. So the power is the probability of not committing a Type II error and hence is denoted by 1 - $\beta$. (\cite{casella:2002} and \cite{lehman:1997} give more thorough treatments of hypothesis testing.)
 
%More generally, let $\theta$ be a population parameter of interest, with $\theta$ $\in$ $\Theta$, the parameter space. Any null hypothesis $H_0$ then partitions the parameter space into $\Theta_0$ and $\Theta_0^c$ with $H_0: \theta \in \Theta_0$ versus $H_a: \theta  \in \Theta_0^c$ as defined in \cite{casella:2002}. \\

%Let $\chi$ be the set of all possible values of $\mathbf{X} = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$. Then a test function or a test rule $\phi(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ is a function from $\chi$ into [0, 1] with the interpretation that if $\mathbf{X} = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$ is observed then $H_0$ is rejected with probability $\phi( \mathbf{X})$. Hence the following definitions:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Probability of Type I error at $\theta \in \Theta_0$ is $E_{\theta} \phi(\mathbf{X})$. 
%\item Probability of Type II error at $\theta \in \Theta_0^c$ is $1 - E_{\theta} \phi(\mathbf{X})$. \item Size or the level of the test function $\phi(\mathbf{X})$ is given by $\max_{\theta \in \Theta_0} E_{\theta} \phi(\mathbf{X}) $.
%\item Power function of $ \phi(\mathbf{X})$ is given by $\Pi_{\phi}(\theta) = E_{\theta} \phi(\mathbf{X})$.
%\end{itemize}


\section{Introduction to Visual Inference} 

\citet{buja:2009} proposes visual statistical methods with an inferential framework. In visual inference the plots take on the role of test statistics, the test statistic is a visual representation of the data, not a numerical value. Comparison data is generated under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, and plots of this data are generated. These plots, known as the null plots gives the ``null distribution of plots'' analogous to the null distribution of test statistics. The plot of the data is compared with the null plots. Variations of these ideas have historically been utilized for data analysis, albeit sparingly, which is commented in the introduction of \cite{buja:2009}. \cite{gelman:2004} puts these ideas in the context of model building. The key feature of \cite{buja:2009} is that it makes the connection to the process of hypothesis testing, and quantifying significance. There are two protocols defined in this paper.

\subsection{Protocols of Visual Inference} \label{sec:protocol} \citet{buja:2009} introduces two protocols for graphical inference: one is the  ``Rorschach'' and the other is the ``lineup''. The purpose of the Rorschach protocol is to measure a data analyst's tendency to over interpret plots in which there is no or spurious structure. On the other hand the lineup provides a simple inferential process to produce a valid p-value for the observed plot. Here we describe the protocols briefly and refer the reader to \citet{buja:2009} and \cite{hadley:2010} for more details. 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Rorschach:} It is possible that the randomness of the data inherits some pattern in the plot. The Rorschach protocol is designed to expose the data analyst's tendency of over-interpretation of patterns when there is actually no or spurious structure. The results are specific to a particular data analyst and a particular data analysis procedure. The protocol estimates the effective family-wise Type I error rate. A data administrator may generate the null plots and decides about the prior information that the data analyst is provided. The administrator may program the series of null plots in such a way that the plot of the real data is inserted in a random location. A toned-down version may also be used for self training. This self training may improve the family-wise error rate of the data analyst and develop an awareness of the features they are most likely to spuriously detect. 
%The human eye can see pattern while there is no pattern in deed. This protocol helps understand the extent of this pattern in the null plots. The process includes asking readers to report what they see in null plots. This helps reader getting acquainted with the natural patterns due to completely randomness. 
The Rorschach protocol is named after the (pop-)psychology Rorschach test, in which subjects interpret abstract ink blots. 

\item {\bf Lineup:} The lineup protocol gets its name after the police lineup of criminal investigation. In a police lineup, the accused is placed among a set of innocent people who may be prisoners, actors or volunteers having no connection with the case. The witness is asked to pick from this lineup. Likewise in a lineup protocol, the accused which is the observed plot is placed randomly among a set of null plots, say $m$, and the witness (in this case the viewer) is asked to identify the plot as most different from the others. If the viewer  can correctly identify the observed plot from the lineup, we have reasons to believe that the observed plot has a specific pattern which is missing in the null plots. This protocol leads to the development of the technique of visual inference by defining the test statistic as a plot that mostly show a specific pattern in the data when alternative hypothesis is true. Figure \ref{lineup} shows a typical lineup. 
\end{itemize}

Let us consider the following example. The data represents the concentration of a metal in mg/kg for two sites A and B.
%Model : $Y_i$ = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1 X_i$ + $\epsilon_i$, \qquad $\epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2)$ \\
%\vspace{0.1cm}
We want to test whether there exists a significant difference between the concentration levels in the two sites A and B. Let $\mu_1$ denote the mean concentration level in Site A and $\mu_2$ denote the mean concentration level in Site B. To test that, we have the following null and alternative hypothesis:
\[
H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 \qquad \hbox{versus} \qquad H_a: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2
\]
%\vspace{0.4cm}
(Technically the problem this data addressed was more interested in testing a one-sided alternative, whether site B has higher concentration than site A, but it is more interesting for this example to consider the two-sided alternative hypothesis.) The test statistic is the plot of the real data. The 19 null plots are generated by assuming that null hypothesis $H_0: \mu_1 =  \mu_2$ is true. So we permute the class variable site to obtain the null plots keeping the other variables fixed. The observed plot is placed randomly among these 19 plots in a lineup given in Figure \ref{lineup}. The viewer is asked to identify the plot which is most different. If the viewer can identify the plot of the real data, we will have reasons to believe that the observed plot has a pattern which is absent in the null plots. So we would reject the null hypothesis. If the viewer cannot identify the observed plot, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

\end{figure}

%\newpage

Plot 16 is the plot of the real data. If the viewer could identify the plot then we have reasons to believe that there exists a statistically significant difference between the mean concentration levels in site A and site B. So the lineup protocol is the basis of the visual inference while the Rorschach protocol helps viewer understand the extent of randomness. 

\cite{majumder:2013} describes a comparative study between the visual inference method and the classical inference methods, focusing on plots that might be used in linear modeling. In his work the expected power of the visual test is compared with the power of the uniformly most powerful (UMP) test. The power of the visual test is computed by responses from several large samples of lineup evaluators recruited through Amazon Turk \citep{turk}. The results suggest that the expected power of a visual test is almost as good as the power of UMP test, that visual inference compares favorably with classical testing, in the traditional setting where the classical test performs well. They established properties and efficacy of visual testing procedures in order to use them in situations where traditional test cannot be used. In addition \cite{majumder:2013} provide a nice way of making the leap traditional hypothesis testing to visual inference. We have adapted that table for the $H_0: \mu_1 =  \mu_2$ vs $H_a: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$ example described and plotted in Figure \ref{lineup}, which can be seen in Table \ref{tbl:compare}.

\end{figure}

In traditional hypothesis testing the sampling distribution of the test statistics is continuous, which allows evaluation of probability on an infinite spectrum. With the lineup, although conceptually we may have an infinite collection of plots from the null distribution, in practice, we sample a finite number of null datasets to generate the lineup. A human judge has a physical limit on the number of null plots they can peruse. This poses one of the issues with using the lineup protocol.  Figure \ref{visual-plot} gives the sampling distribution (black curve) for the $t$-distribution, along with the $t$-statistics of the samples that were drawn from the null distribution (blue bars) and that of the observed data (red bar) for the plots in the lineup shown in Figure \ref{lineup}. Effectively,  in visual inference the red line is compared only to these finite number of blue lines visually to make a decision, unlike classical inference where we look at the rejection region (Figure \ref{classical}) to make decisions. So as Tukey suggested, there may be a ``bad'' random sample of null plots which may affect our decision. This is a major component of this thesis research to we develop techniques to determine the quality of a lineup. In practice, though, it needs to be noted, that visual inference will not typically be used in applications where there is an existing classical test. The purpose of visual inference is not to compete with classical statistics -- its purpose is to provide formalism and quantification in problems where there are none, currently. For the purposes of research and assessment we use the classical setting because it provides benchmarks for how visual inference will likely perform.

%In their paper \citet{buja:2009} presented some of the issues related to visual inference. For example the wording of the instruction for viewers while evaluating lineup plots, information related to the viewers responses, effect of colors or gaps in the plot on the responses. These issues need to be examined before more general implementation of visual inference. In my thesis work I intend to address these issues elaborately.

%\subsection{Evaluation of the Lineup Plots} Single or multiple observer can evaluate a lineup plot. If a individual observer evaluates a lineup of $m$ plots, the p-value is reported as $\le \frac1m$ when the null hypothesis is rejected and $\ge 1-\frac1m$ when the null hypothesis could not be rejected. For for a pool of $K$ observers we have $$ U \sim Binom(K,\frac1m)$$ where $U$ is the number of successful evaluations. Thus we have the p-value as $$Pr(U \ge u)= \sum_{k \ge u}^K {{K \choose k} (\frac1m)^k(1-\frac1m)^{(K-k)}}$$ where $u$ be the observed number of successful evaluations. Due to the discrete nature of binomial distribution this p-value is conservative.
%
%The type-I error probability is fixed to be $\frac1m$ as per the design of the lineup plot.

\section{Overview}

My research extends the visual inference methodology in two ways -- by producing metrics to quantify lineups and examine how people read statistical plots, and examining how it applies to assessing dimension reduction in high dimension low sample size (HDLSS) problems. 

Chapter \ref{ch:largepsmalln} explores the performance of dimension reduction methods such as  projection pursuit for high dimension, low sample size (HDLSS) data. The key points of interest were producing a way to evaluate an algorithm when its results are primarily visual, and to examine how well people can distinguish between real separation and noise in HDLSS data.  I conducted several human subjects experiment using simulated data to provide controlled conditions. Results suggest that people can detect real separation from pure noise up to a reasonably high dimension. The broader community still has difficulty in understanding HDLSS data, which can be seen by published papers where the authors get excited about structure in low-dimensional projections, when it is really present simply because of the sparseness of high-dimensions. My work suggests that the lineup protocol can potentially explain HDLSS issues effectively. The work is accepted for publication by Computational Statistics. \\

Chapter \ref{ch:metrics} focusses on developing metrics to describe the quality of a lineup. In conventional inference, the test statistic is compared to all possible values of the sampling distribution, but in visual inference only a finite number of plots are drawn randomly from the sampling distribution. Understanding the effect of these finite comparisons is important. This work develops a variety of distance metrics that can be used to measure the ``closeness'' of observed data plot with the null plots. These metrics are compared to the results from human subjects experiments. These metrics may be useful to learn how people detect the observed data plot from the null plots. For example, with the HDLSS simulations, traditional class separation metrics like WBratio do not match the results from people as well as a metric measuring the gap between clusters. \\

Chapter \ref{ch:nullabor} describes the R package \textbf{nullabor} which generates the lineup plots automatically if the observed data and the null generating mechanism are provided. I added routines to calculate the distance metrics on the lineup. Some common distance metrics are included in the package and users have the freedom of using their own distance metrics. The package also provides diagnostic plots for comparing a lineup with other possible lineups that may have been generated. \\

%Chapter \ref{ch:teaching} develops teaching materials to improve statistical thinking among undergraduate students and among people who are familiar with statistical methods. \\ 
%
%Chapter \ref{ch:application} would most likely use the lineup protocol to make inference in a large $n$ setting. The goal is to examine how the visual inference procedure works in a real life situation. This chapter also looks at the ``sufficient'' statistic. \\

Finally, chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} provides a summary of the dissertation and discussion of possible future research work. 

\section{Scope of my Research}

This dissertation provides the ground work for the application of visual inference. It applies visual inference methods in a high dimension, low sample size (HDLSS) framework. A real dataset was used to test a hypothesis for which no conventional tests exist right now. This dissertation also develops certain concepts in the lineup protocol which increases the applicability of visual inference and nullify the effect of finite null plots. Finally, an open source package provides tools to increase the ease of visual inference. 


%\section{Validation of the Protocols}
%
%\citet{buja:2009} suggested evaluating the performance of the protocols using \cite{turk} Mechanical Turk web site. The goal is to estimate the family-wise Type I error rates for each data situation. This web site also allows us to keep record of time taken to complete a task, the reason why the individuals pick in a lineup, together with a confidence rating. Turk worker do not necessarily make-up of a representative population sample. Thus to make a correction of this selection bias we can collect some demographic information such as age, gender, education level or location of the worker. The Mechanical Turk has also been used to collect data for the Fleshmap project by \cite{viegas:2008}.
%
%We have done couple of turk studies and some results are displayed in chapter \ref{ch:regression}. More results are to be presented in chapter \ref{ch:turk} and \ref{ch:turk_analysis}.
%
%\section{Background}Statistical graph or plot of data has its presence way before the development of the classical inference procedures. The first recorded instance of statistical graphics based on the data was known to be in the year 1644 (variations in determination of longitude between Toledo and Rome as illustrated by \cite{friendly:2001}). The development of fundamental classical inferential procedures took around two hundred years from Bernoulli through Fisher (1713 to 1935 as per \cite{hald:2004}). 
%
%I intend to write down a little history of the statistical graphics in this section. The goal is to identify why the graphics were not used as a tool for statistical inference even though we see its presence way before the development of classical inference techniques. One factor could be the absence of modern computing facilities. But to what extent does the lack of computing facility prevent statistical graphics from being used as the tool for statistical inference?

%\section{Explanation of chapters and scope} I described some materials that I intend to include in chapter \ref{ch:introduction}. While one of our goals is to analyze the performance of the lineup protocol in finding the pattern of the data when it is actually present we have specific focuses in the different chapters. These are described below;
%
%Chapter \ref{ch:regression} develops the visual inference procedure for a simple linear regression setting with normally distributed error structure. The purpose is to show how the visual inference technique perform in the very fundamental inferential procedure. This chapter also provides the various methods of obtaining power of the proposed visual test. The results obtained from the human subject experiment is stunning and the paper based on these findings won the ASA student paper competition 2011. 
%
%Chapter \ref{ch:turk} describes the procedure of designing an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment to evaluate the performance of visual inference technique. This explains the detailed factors to be considered while running the experiment. 
%
%Chapter \ref{ch:turk_analysis} is designed to present analysis of the data obtained from various turk experiments. The focus is to identify whether demographical factors are influential in visual evaluation of plots. The time taken for each evaluation may depend on the difficulty level of the plot. This will allow us to come up with some measure for the difficulty level of each lineup plot. 
%
%Chapter \ref{ch:application} focuses on the real data study. The goal is to examine how the visual inferential procedure perform in the case of real data. We intend to study the performance of line up protocols with the real data and compare them with what we obtained from simulated data.
%
%Finally chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} displays my completed tasks so far as well as the plans and timelines of my work for the next year. Some of the future directions of research are also described even though they may not be under the scope of this dissertation work.
